# Installation

Kuro was developed with TypeScript in mind, so it assumes your Vue 3 project is using TypeScript for best compatibility.

::: code-group
```npx
npx github:Bartek-Nowak/Kuro init
```

::: warning
⚠️ The Tailwind CSS installation performed by init is specifically designed and tested for projects using Vite as the build tool.
If your project uses a different bundler or setup, the automatic configuration may not work correctly, and you will need to add Tailwind CSS manually.
